# Microsoft Word templates for submission to Geomorphica
This respository includes Microsoft Word templates of the **title page** and the **anonymous manuscript** for submissions to the journal Geomorphica (https://geomorphica.org). Submissions using these templates are highly preferable by the editorial team. The LaTeX templates are also available here: https://github.com/Geomorphica/LaTex_template.git

Please refer to our auther guidelines (https://journals.psu.edu/geomorphica/authorguidelines) for details about submission formatting. **The initial submission should be preferably pdf files**, and **final submissions after acceptance as docx or LaTeX files**. We recommend using Geomorphica templates as this will help the publication process post-acceptance. Since Geomorphica has opted for a triple-anonymous peer-review process, we require two files to be submitted:
* the title page of the manuscript, including:
  * all authors, including affiliation and if available ORCID,
  * email address of corresponding author,
  * author contributions statement,
  * acknowledgements
  * data and code availability statement
  * funding statement
  * conflict of interest disclosure
  * permission to reproduce material from copyrighted sources
* the **manuscript should be anonymized**. It should contain line numbers, and a minimum font size of 11. Figures and tables should appear within the text at the appropriate points rather than as separate files.

### About the journal
Geomorphica is a community-led and community-driven **Diamond Open Access journal** that promotes academic discourse and disseminates research results pertaining to all aspects of geomorphology, including, but not limited to, landscapes and landforms, earth and other planetary near-surface processes, and the mechanisms, dynamics and timescales pertaining to these processes. Diamond Open Access journals are **free for all to read, without subscription, and do not charge article processing fees to authors**.
